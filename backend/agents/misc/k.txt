create a physics video of a ball rolling down a hill. output dir: ./output/ball. Be creative. Complexity: a more advanced explanation involving energy conservation make sure to show vectors, rate of change, derviations, etc. Duration: 1-3 mins (medium). Ensure you always correctly use the tools and follow the instructions perfectly. You cannot do anything without using the tools. If you do not use a tool you are actively giving up as that will terminate your agentic flow.
