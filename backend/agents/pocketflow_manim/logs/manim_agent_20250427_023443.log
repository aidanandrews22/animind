However, the prompt requested specific advanced physics concepts (energy conservation, vectors, rate of change, derivations). I need to read the generated code in `./output/animation.py` to assess if it adequately covers these requirements before deciding whether edits are needed or if the task is complete.

2025-04-27 02:35:21,938 - manim_agent - INFO - Reasoning: The basic scene setup is complete. The next step is to add the physics elements, starting with the force vectors acting on the ball: gravity, normal force, and friction. I will also decompose the gravity vector into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline. This addresses the TODO items in lines 63 and 64.
